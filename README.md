After almost 2 years I'm using this system on board, this is what it improved onboard :

-I have constantly a pretty good estimation of the quantity of diesel onboard. However, it is necessary to readjust the estimated quantity given by the engine monitor (throw its configuration page) time to time. I usually readjust the quantity when I fill up the primary tank with some gericanes or with the secondary tank. The quantity estimated is always pessimistic, so I never had bad surprise ...
-I feel more confortable to know the engine monitor monitors the temperature by the exhaust. I will be alerted immediatly if somethins is wrong with the salt water colling system ...

-The maintenance of the engine is now straighforward, because the engine monitor supply the engine age throw Bluetooth to the software I developped in Java to manage the engine maintenance.
